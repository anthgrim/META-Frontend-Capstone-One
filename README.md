# Lucky Shrub - Frontend META Coursera Capstone Project

## Website Information

### Title: Lucky Shrub Website

### Description:

By completing the lessons in this course, you have acquired the necessary HTML and CSS skills and knowledge to develop a home page with a header, main content and footer. You will have to decide whether you are going to use a grid or flexbox layout for your home page. Your header should contain the client logo and the main content should be a large promotional banner with three columns with text and images below it. Your footer will have two columns: the first column should have a small logo and the second one should have copywriting information. When it comes to styling, you'll have to create the appropriate look and feel for your client's target audience. Remember, you want to create intentional engagement!

To enable you to do all of this, the module covers the most essential features of your project. This includes: selecting your fictional client, working out your layout, positioning the elements, planning the user experience, creating themes and setting up your local development environment.
